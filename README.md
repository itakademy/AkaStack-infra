AkaStack-infra
---

AkaStack is a fully integrated development and deployment platform designed to provide a stable, reproducible, and production-grade environment for modern web applications.
It combines infrastructure, tooling, and application orchestration into a single, coherent stack, allowing teams to focus on building products rather than assembling environments.

**AckaStack-infra is subpart of the AckaStack project.
